## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to write cleaner codes using CSS classes, particularly using JS to manipulate classes to make HTML content be hidden or visible.

### Continued development

I love to improve on my JavaScript skills on DOM manipulation as this is the first challenge that I have undertaken that required a bit of JS. Cheers to many more challenges like this.
